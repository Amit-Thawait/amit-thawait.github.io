It was occasion for XP-conf in Bangalore. This was a first XP conference in India. Our collegue Shirish Padlkar has submitted this abstract and as he was not in India, we grabbed this opportunity and started prep for the same!

 It was a two-day conference and it was a mix in audience! Some people were relatively new to concepts of XP and some seems to be interested in knowing more about knowing what is better way to do certain things!

and the day was here! It all started with marketing your own talk! We had stand up where all speakers talked about why people should attend their talk, how someone get advantage by attending this! We did our marketing well(hope so ;) ! We saw a good turnaround for our talk (We did marketing very well, it seems! ;) )
