I entered into corporate world realized a lot of flaws in education system. It is more theoretical than practical, no any clear idea what happens in IT world, professor focus on regular curriculum, not a known person/mentor who could guide potentially and many such thoughts popped into my mind! Time flew and it was my turn to do something for the students in engineering/diploma.

 Otari mam happened to contact me and it was An "Aha!" moment! She wanted me to conduct some activities in the college, which will essentially help students. She is of the opinion, _"Immediate seniors telling us something gives more inspiration than someone rooted in that field!, students can connect and relate better!"_
   I started thinking what I can tell to these students by kind of exposure I had and still make an impression and inspire them!

 I was thrilled, excited, happy and nervous!

**Just an Introduction!**
<sub>2014, November</sub>

This was very first session I did in Orchid college, Solapur. It was for Final year students.

Purpose of this session was to share my journey till now. I did some homework, what I want to tell and how they can be benefited by this.
I talked about my role, what I do at ThoughtWorks, what is actual work we have to do, meetings and ended up talking about agile! I also addressed the points where it's very necessary to take Final year project seriously and how it can benefit them!
   They liked this session. I kept it interactive! They asked me many questions and were curious to know what happens in those big IT buildings! We talked about maintaining online profile, reading technical blogs, doing different online courses can help them a lot! Only time to study you can get is in college, you can make habit of learning new things, being adaptive and build profile along side!

I was happy to know that this session helped them, at least inspired them to do something!
I learnt many things from this small discussion. Have patience and empathy to understand them and make them talk!
This gave me further insight of what I can plan next! I wanted to take some hands on session. Mam and I talked about this, we decided to take further sessions for third year students in Feb/March as they will be free by exams till that time!

**Some tools, and some fundamentals!**
<sub>2015, March</sub>

I always thought, If I could know this in my engineering ...!

I was never good at just delivering sessions! I wanted to teach them something which could help them to build up their online profile!

 1. There are many gaps in college curriculum and actual work you do in industry!
 2. Many things you learnt at college, but you dont see implication of those and you feel less thrilled about it and hence one end up in reading books rather than understanding them!
 3. College is the time, where you can learn, read, try out many things! When you start working, you get very less time! With lack of direction, knowledge, student end up in reading/mugging up books!


Lately in March 2015, I took session on git for third year students!  I remembered problems I have faced when I was not aware about some version control system.
It was more around how it will help them in college and eventually in industry, be it whatever profession they choose!

 1. Help them in regular assignments, and for teachers its just one link to check, like we do submit on coursera!
 2. It will help them in not only tech things, will help to maintain blogs, share their travel experiecnes, or whatever!
 3. It will ofcourse alsong side build up their online profile, and as they will explore more, learning will be there!

Planned to take hands on session at the same time, but could not do that! It was just 2 hour session and later came to know from Otari mam, that they found it helpful. [This feedback](http://bit.do/git_session) gave me more insights into what next I can plan. They did try that very next day and started using it!  This session where I taught, I learnt!

_When you teach, you learn; when you give, you get!_

This experience was something very different than what I do daily!
It felt nice to teach them and during this I remembered teachers who made an impact on me: I owe whatever I'm today to them!
