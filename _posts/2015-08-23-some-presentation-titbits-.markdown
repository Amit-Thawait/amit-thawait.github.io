I'm still a beginner at my speaking skills, but If you follow some tricks, you can make a really good impression.
 Here are my some learning, I have learnt while pairing on some of the presentations!

 + **Start presentation with something which will grab audience's attention!**

    Most people when they come to work with us already have some idea of how their speech will go.  And the most common mistake people make is starting wrong.  They begin with some polite thanks, a little self-introduction, perhaps a shout-out to someone in the audience!

    But you will say what's wrong with this?

    World has changed! Audience will start snoring if you don't start your presentation with something that will wake up their senses! So jump right in, start with an action!

    Use some analogy and link that to your talk or give some case study and your entire talk will revolve around that or may be just start with joke just make audience to laugh! (if you talk is after lunch, you should really think about this :P) or you can quote someone and then start or with funny picture or you can may be start with a question (It may be direct or rhetorical!) or ....!
    The point is, grabbing audience attention is like ice breaker!

     Well, Yahya started with story in [XP-conf talk](/blog/speaking-at-xp-conf/) where we paired and as soon as he finished story, people started clapping and that was the _aha_ moment!:relaxed:

 + **Judge your audience!**

    Know your audience and what they do! What if majority of audience is from non-technical background, and you start talking too much technical!
    Show off hands always works! Depending on this you might want to take a call, either you can tell audience that it will not help them much and they can attend other talk or you can tweak the content little here and there!

    Review your presentation with other people, that helps to understand audience perspective!

 + **Prepare a lot!**

    >It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare impromptu speech! -- Mark Twain

     Yes, Pairing ease our lot of tasks, like you have always other opinion/view on the content you will be talking and you can come up with really good ideas!
      But at the same time, you need to rehearse! There are lot of things which you should be careful about, the switching between pairs should be smooth and clean, who will hold clicker, whose turn it will be and many! Do dry runs as many as possibles!

 + **Presenter notes**

    I do generally forget important points or just drag one point so much or I go on talking on some different point! :expressionless:

    Writing down actual points you will be talking helps a lot and help you to come on the point for people like me!

+ **Don't be too heavy!**

    This doesn't mean you have to lose your weight! :stuck_out_tongue:

     >If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough! --Albert Einstein

     Well, you need to understand why are you presenting and for whom! If college students, you can't use so much organization jargon, you need to give some examples so that they can relate. Share your experiences, tell some famous stories, and then you are making your job easy!

+ **Shock your audience!**

    Yes, that helps again to grab audience attention and to wake up them :wink:
    
    There are plethora of ways to shock audience. You can in between end the presentation, may be show some funny slide/video, make them to imagine what if ..!

 + **Try to make it as interactive as possible!**

    >Presentations aren't about presenter, they're about audience and what audience needs. If the presenter is talking too much it's a sign that he or she has forgotten who's important!

    Yes, So you need to be so much cautious! The simple trick is, if you feel little thirsty, ask the audience! Look at audience reaction, judge them and ask questions, promote them to tell their stories, or may be tell them share their learning! It's great way where you can keep it interactive, get them engaged and get you most connected with them!
