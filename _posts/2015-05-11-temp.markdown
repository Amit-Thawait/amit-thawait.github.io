When I was in PICT, our seniors working in some companies shared their experience with us. Those were sessions, from which we atleast came to know how the IT world is! These made a lot of impact as it was given by immediate seniors.

Sooner I entered into this corporate world realized a lat of flaws in education system. It was more theoretical than practical, no any clear idea what happens in IT world, professor focus on regular curriculum, not a known person/mentor who could guide potentially and many such things!  Time flew and it was my turn to do something for the student in engineering/diploma.

 Otari mam happened to contact me about conducting some activities in the college.
Again many thoughts started popping in my head:

 1. There are many gaps in college curriculum and actual work you do in industry!
 2. Many things you learnt at college, but you dont see implication of those and you feel less thrilled about it and hence one end up in reading books rather than understanding them!
 3. College is the time, where you can learn, read, try out many things! When you start working, you get very less time! With lack of direction, knowledge, student end up in reading/mugging up books!

 I always thought, If I could know this in my engineering ...!

 I was thrilled, excited, happy and nervous!
I  was thrilled and excited that I could do what I wanted to be!Nervous as I had to face 100 people!


**Just an Introduction, What is corporate world like!**
<sub>2014, November</sub>


First session happened in 2014, it was for final year students.
It was interactive session, where I shared my experience of being at ThoughtWorks, in turn ended up telling them about what agile is, what is our day in company like, some cool factors about the company! I also told them what my last year project was and seriousness of taking this project activities seriously, be it whatever field they will choose, this will definitely help them!
Many of them had planned for further graduation as no campus available. I felt, this is the time they can build up their profile and could do potentially something!
I told them various ways they can try, what will happen if they will join some of the institute, they should not end up in same situation!
I was happy to know from many people, that it helped them!

**Some tools, and some fundamentals!**
<sub>2015, March</sub>

I was never good at just delivering sessions! I wanted to teach them something which could help them to build up their online profile!

Lately in March 2015, I took session on git for third year students! I wanted to make it interactive. I remembered problems I have faced when I was not aware about some version control system.
It was more around how it will help them in college and eventually in industry, be it whatever profession they choose!

 1. Help them in regular assignments, and for teachers its just one link to check, like we do submit on coursera!
 2. It will help them in not only tech things, will help to maintain blogs, share their travel experiecnes, or whatever!
 3. It will ofcourse alsong side build up their online profile, and as they will explore more, learning will be there!

Planned to take hands on session at the same time, but could not do that because they had exams! It was just 2 hour session and later came to know from Otari mam, that they found it helpful. [This feedback](http://bit.do/git_session) gave me more insights into what next I can plan. This session where I taught, I learnt!

_When you teach, you learn; when you give, you get!_

This experience was something very different than what I do daily!
It felt nice to teach them.
